Created multiple project for the Oasis Infobyte Internship
<h3>1. Customer Segmentation Analysis:-</h3>
This project uses customer segmentation to analyze an e-commerce companyâ€™s customer behaviors and purchase patterns. By applying K-Means clustering, I segmented customers based on their purchasing behaviors, revealing insights into high-value groups and targeted product preferences. Our approach includes data cleaning, EDA, feature scaling, and cluster analysis, resulting in actionable insights for optimizing marketing strategies and improving customer engagement. Visualizations highlight key spending behaviors across clusters, helping the business tailor its marketing efforts.

- Algorithm used K Mean Clustering.
- Determined the optimal number of clusters using the silhouette score and Elbow plot.

<h3>2. Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression:-</h3>
This project uses Linear Regression to predict house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, parking availability etc. Key steps included data preprocessing (outlier removal, feature scaling, encoding), model training, and evaluation using R-squared, Adjusted R-squared and Mean Squared Error. The model achieved a reasonable fit, with area and number of bedrooms as significant predictors, and residual analysis confirmed a normal distribution of errors, meeting linear regression assumptions.

- Algorithm used Linear Regression.
- Evaluation Metrics are R-squared, Adjusted R-squared and MSE.

<h3>3. Wine Quality Prediction:-</h3>
This project focuses on predicting wine quality based on chemical properties using various classification algorithms. By analyzing a dataset of wine characteristics, I applied data preprocessing steps (e.g., handling duplicates, transforming skewed features) and used Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) models to evaluate prediction performance. The SVC model achieved the highest accuracy (~60.8%) in distinguishing wine quality levels, particularly around common scores. This project offers insights into the impact of chemical features on wine quality and demonstrates predictive modeling techniques in Python.

- Algorithm used are Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Support Vector Classifier (SVC).
- Evaluation Metrics accuracy score.
